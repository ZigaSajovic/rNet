# rNet
Batched RNN + LSTM in Python and Numpy

For an example of use consult the [char_example.py](https://github.com/ZigaSajovic/rNet/blob/master/char_example.py) file, where the model is used to train a character level text generator, as seen in the paper [Generating Sequences With Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0850) by Alex Graves.

## Sample results

We present results achievable with a one layer LSTM + Softmax network trained on the two data sets available in [data](https://github.com/ZigaSajovic/rNet/tree/master/data), using the code provided in [char_example.py](https://github.com/ZigaSajovic/rNet/blob/master/char_example.py).
